An ever-expanding module of functions that I expect will come in handy during later projects

From formatting numbers (adding commas) to a Caesar cipher, this is the definition of random. But some of them might come in handy for me (and possibly you) later on. So here they all are in a nice package.

Includes:
- formatNumber (adds commas to a number to make it look nice)
- take (takes and returns n elements from the start of an array, nondestructive)
- endTake (takes and returns n elements from the end of an array, nondestructive)
- numberBetween (returns a random number in-between two argument numbers)
- A "Caesar" class that allows you to set a shift and then encrypt/decrypt at leisure.
